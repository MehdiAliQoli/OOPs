# OOPs
## Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the combination of the class and the method.
## Constructor:
The C++ calls automatically.
For example, if a class of teacher is made and when we write teacher t1 it will initialize it automatically which means contractor.
Same name as the class
Memory allocation happens when the constructor is called.
If we do not make a constructor than the compiler do it automatically.
